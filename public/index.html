<!-- HOW TO REQUEST -->
<font color="palegreen"><b>HOW TO REQUEST FOR ANIMATED SIGS</b></font><br><br>

Hi there guyz and gals, and fellow MuTizens, most especially to our friends and Allies out there! ^_^
Please follow the preceding instructions should 
you want to request me for an animated sig of your character. &nbsp; <i>-tarrent</i><br><br><br><br>

<font color="palegreen"><b>OPTION #1: &nbsp; YOU TAKE THE SCREENSHOTS, I'LL DO THE EDITTING</b></font>
<ol>
<li>First, set your Mu Game resolution to <b>1024x768.</b></li>
<li>Choose your favorite spot online (in-game).</li>
<li>Start getting your character's screenshots by simultaneously pressing the <b>Printscreen Button</b> 


at your fastest affordable rate as your character performs whatever stunts you want it to do.
</li>
<li>Reminders: Please be aware that the resulting animated sig's movements will greatly depend on
<b>how fast</b> you press the Printscreen Button. Each successive printscreen must
have at least a 1 millisecond interval between each press. Anything slower than 1millisec
to 1sec Printscreen intervals will result to a "laggy-looking" sig. ^^<br> See the example
screenshots-series provided <a href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/weaponsforge-demo.appspot.com/o/sigs-request%2Ffiles%2Freiz-RAWIMAGES.zip?alt=media&token=dbd8e83f-4a4e-4269-aa61-25596436e6db">
<b><u>here</u></b></a>.</li>
<li>For sigs with <b>2 or more animated characters</b> on the same sig, please make sure you take the characters'
screenshots on the same <b>coordinates.</b> For example, you want to have a sig featuring your BK and your WIZ. 
If you take your BK's screenshots on the Lost Towers at (150,22), then your WIZ's screenshots must also be taken on
the <b>same, exact coordinates</b> of the Lost Towers at (150,22).</li>
<li>Gather your character's screenshots, place it on a zipped archive and mail it to me at:
<font color="white"><b>tester@some_email.com</b></font><br>
You could send as many screenshots as you want, as long as it won't exceed your email's attachments capacity.
</li>

<li>Don't forget to specify the <u>Titles</u>, <u>Character Name</u>, <u>Guild Name</u>, <u>captions</u>,
<u>quotes</u> and etc you might want to placed in your sig, or just let me know if you don't want to have any. Failure to do so
would mean that I will have to place heart-inspiring <i>Love Quotes</i> &nbsp; on your sig :D</li>
<li>Having a hard time taking the screenshots? Lets proceed to <b>OPTION #2</b></li>

</ol><br><br><br>

<font color="palegreen"><b>OPTION #2: &nbsp; <u>I'LL TAKE YOUR SCREENSHOTS</u> AND DO THE EDITTING</b></font>
<ol>
<li>This option doesn't mean that you will have to give me your password so that I may open your account and
take your character's screenshots at my leisure! :D</li>
<li>Our characters must meet online. I will place my character somehwere just within the sight of your character,
as your character do whatever stunts it wants to do. I will take the screenshots from there.<br>
<a href="http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r197/tarrent01/mu_misc/example.jpg">
<b></b></a><b><a href="javascript:openWindow('http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r197/tarrent01/mu_misc/example.jpg',0,0,'yes','yes');" title="">
[View example]</a></b></li>
<li>I do not play Mu very often nowadays due to strict time constraints and other important matters.
However, you could see me in-game almost always during the <font color="white"><b>12pm CC's on Mon, Wed,
Thurs and Fri,</b></font> after which usually linger online for another 10-15min after the Event. We could
take your screenshots after the 12pm CC, or you could specify a <b>date and time</b> when we would meet online.</li>

<li>And lastly, do not forget to specify the <u>Titles</u>, <u>Character Name</u>, <u>Guild Name</u>, <u>captions</u>,
<u>quotes</u> and etc you might want to place in your sig, or just let me know if you don't want to have any. Failure to do so
would mean that I will have to place heart-inspiring <i>Love Quotes</i> &nbsp; on your sig :D</li>

<li>Additional remarks about <b>OPTION #2:</b><br>
There seems to be in-game glitches when I am taking other characters'
screenshots, with my character at a distance on the screen. Some of
them include:
<ul><li><b>Blade Knights/Knights</b> turn away from the screen when casting 
<u><a href="javascript:openWindow('http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r197/tarrent01/misc/jefflim01b1.gif',0,0,'yes','yes');" title="">
Greater Fortitude.</a></u></li>
<li><b>Soul Masters/Wizards</b> turn away from the screen when casting 
<u><a href="javascript:openWindow('http://i144.photobucket.com/albums/r197/tarrent01/kobalos/sogun1a-4.gif',0,0,'yes','yes');" title="">
Nova.</a></u></li>
</ul></li>If you don't want your characters turning their backs from
the screen as they cast their spells or perform their skills, then I
suggest
that we do your sig using <b>OPTION #1.</b> Based on experience, these glitches won't happen if you yourself will take your character's
screenshots, with your character alone in the middle of the screen. ^^
</ol><br><br><br>


<font color="palegreen"><b>OPTION #3: &nbsp; I'LL TAKE THE SCREENSHOTS <u>USING MY CHARACTERS AS SUBSTITUTE FOR YOUR CHARACTER/S</u></b><u></u></font>
<ol>
<li>Does your character happen to be a <font color="white"><b>Wizard</b></font> or an
<font color="white"><b>MG?</b></font> If yes, then I can take my own characters' screenshots and substitute
them for your character.</li>
<li>Just don't forget to specify the <u>Titles</u>, <u>Character Name</u>, <u>Guild Name</u>, <u>captions</u>,
<u>quotes</u> and etc you might want to place in your sig.</li>
</ol><br><br><br>


<font color="palegreen"><b>OPTION #4: YOU'LL DO THE SREENSHOTS AND THE EDITTING ^^</b></font>
<ol>
<li>Challenge your creativity! <font color="white"><b><a href="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/weaponsforge-demo.appspot.com/o/sigs-request%2Ffiles%2FREIZEN.rar?alt=media&token=c87db227-4b49-4cae-bb5d-d78b425388a1">Download</a></b></font>
